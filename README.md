# AnimalKingdom
The app was implemented as a homework for a potential employer.

Here is the how the task was formulated:

The task–if you choose to accept it–is to create the "Animal Kingdom" iOS application using the attached animal.json file. The app allows the user to browse and learn more about the animals. How you accomplish this task and how you want the information to be displayed, is up to you. Your submission will be judged based on code quality, creativity, and the final product. 

Here are the specs:
You are welcome to use any 3rd party libraries or tools to help you accomplish the task. 
We are asking you to NOT use Storyboard or XIBs to better show off your coding ability.
Optional: Have a very simple backend that returns the JSON in the attached file, just like an API. 
Once finished, please zip all the files and the project folder and email it back to me. We are looking forward to seeing what you'd be able to come up with :)

Have fun!
