# AnimalKingdom
The app was implemented as a homework for a potential employer.


The task was to create the "Animal Kingdom" iOS application using provided JSON file. The app allows the user to browse and learn more about the animals. 

It was up to me how I accomplish this task and how to display the information.

Below are the specs as provided by the client:

1. You are welcome to use any 3rd party libraries or tools to help you accomplish the task. 

2. We are asking you to NOT use Storyboard or XIBs to better show off your coding ability.

3. Optional: Have a very simple backend that returns the JSON in the attached file, just like an API.
